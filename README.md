# Simon-Game

üéÆ Project Overview
The Simon Game is a memory-based game where players must replicate an increasingly complex sequence of colors and sounds. Each correct repetition advances the player to a higher level, adding a new step to the sequence. An incorrect input ends the game, prompting a restart.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Concepts
HTML5: Structures the game's interface, including the title, level display, and four colored buttons (green, red, yellow, blue).
CSS3: Styles the game's appearance, utilizing custom fonts like "Press Start 2P" for a retro aesthetic.
JavaScript & jQuery: Handles game logic, including sequence generation, user input tracking, event handling, and DOM manipulation.

Key concepts reinforced through this project include:

‚Ä¢ Event handling for both keyboard and mouse interactions.
‚Ä¢ Dynamic DOM manipulation to reflect game state changes.
‚Ä¢ Audio integration for feedback on user actions.
‚Ä¢ State management to track game progress and user input sequences.

üß† Learning Outcomes
By completing the Simon Game Challenge, I've:
‚Ä¢ learned how to structure an interactive web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
‚Ä¢ understood how to use jQuery to simplify event handling and DOM manipulation.
‚Ä¢ developed the ability to generate and track a random sequence of events (the game's pattern logic).
‚Ä¢ implemented real-time user feedback using sounds and animations.
‚Ä¢ managed game state transitions such as starting, progressing levels, and restarting after a wrong move.
‚Ä¢ practiced debugging and refining JavaScript logic to match specific game rules.
‚Ä¢ gained experience integrating multimedia elements like audio for an enhanced user experience.
‚Ä¢ built a complete memory game from scratch that reinforces core front-end development skills.
